# Lexus IS200 Cluster
This repo contains all the information needed to hook a cluster up and use it for racing games.

This project has been used to redeem my SLO (personal skill development) credits.

## Preview



## Built With

* [Simhub](https://www.simhubdash.com/) - Used to retrieve game data (requires purchasing a license for the best result)
* An Arduino  uno/nano/pro micro
  Note: ESP support has been mentioned, but currently is not supported.
* Soldering iron
* Wires
Note: having the original 'a' & 'b' connector will be really usefull, but if you can't/don't have them you will need 10 extra male-male or male-female wires.
